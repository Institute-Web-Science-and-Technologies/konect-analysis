This is the KONECT analysis component (KONECT-Analysis).  It allows to run
analyses of KONECT networks in parallel. 

== How to Use ==

* Mount, link, symlink or copy uni/ into this directory.  The uni/
  directory must be present and contain all out.* and meta.* files.   
* (optional) Mount, link, symlink or copy plot/ and dat/ from the analysis/
  directory to here.  
* (optional) Install libraries as described in lib/README.  Not all
  targets need extra libraries. 
* Execute "stu"; see main.stu for targets.

Output is written to dat/ (data files) and plot/ (plots).  On most hosts
where KONECT anlaysis is run, dat/ and plot/ are symlinks to mounted
directories.  

== Needed packages ==

* Stu:  also available from the KONECT authors
* g++
* python-rdflib (for RDF generation only)
* matlab_bgl
