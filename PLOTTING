The plots generated by KONECT are stored as "plot/*.eps". 

All plots are printed with the function konect_print().  That function
also contains style recommendations for plots. 

== Names of plots ==

All plots are named like this:

plot/$SCRIPT.$TYPE.$NETWORK.eps

where

* $SCRIPT is the name of the generating script (without "_plot" is present")
* $TYPE is the type, when one script generates multiple plots; Typically
  single letters, with "a" being the main plot, i.e. the only plot
  declared in the Makefile. 
* $NETWORK is the network name, and is always the last part of the name

All name parts should be in all-lowercase, with words separated by
dashes or underscores.
